**Testing with Postman **

1. Import the provided `API.postman_collection.json` into Postman. (Available in the folder!)
2. Configure environment variables for base URL and tokens.
3. Unleash your inner tester! Each endpoint is ready for exploration.

**Deployment **

Ready to unleash this backend to the world? Here's how to deploy it to Google Cloud Run:

1. **Build the Container Image:**
   ```bash
   gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/<PROJECT-ID>/<SERVICE-NAME>
   ```
2. **Deploy the Container Image to Cloud Run:**
   ```bash
   gcloud run deploy <SERVICE-NAME> --image gcr.io/<PROJECT-ID>/<SERVICE-NAME> --platform managed
   ```

**Remember to replace`<PROJECT-ID>` and `<SERVICE-NAME>` with your own project and service details!**

**We're excited to see this backend power amazing applications! **

**Additional Notes:**

* Consider adding badges for technologies used (e.g., Python, Flask, Docker).
* Explore adding screenshots or GIFs to further showcase functionality.
* Link to any relevant documentation for deeper exploration.

By incorporating these suggestions, your README.md will be both informative and visually appealing, attracting more attention and user engagement on GitHub!
